- Commander Shepard
„I should go.“
„We fight or we die. That's the plan.“
„I’m Commander Shepard, and this is my favorite store on the Citadel.“
„Did someone say 'party'? Because I’m already here.“
„I’m not just the hero of the galaxy. I’m also the galaxy’s worst babysitter.“
„War is hell. Sometimes you’re the hammer. Sometimes you’re the nail.“
